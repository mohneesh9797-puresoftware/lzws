It is possible to test lzws and ncompress in real world.
There are a lot of "tar.Z" archives available on the internet.
You can check it by using any search engine with query like '"tar.Z" index|directory|listing|ftp|file|archive'.

We can use some search engine api for automatic search.
The easiest way is to use searx.
It is a metasearch engine that provides results from popular search engines.
It is possible to receive about 20-30% results of real search engines using it's api.
20% of results are enough for testing purposes.

It is better to make this search using tor, so scripts are wrapped using torsocks.
You need to have tor up and running before using these scripts.

Some searx endpoints won't provide results for tor exit node IPs.
So we will use all available endpoints from "stats.searx.xyz".

-----

Search results are the list of page urls.
We will visit pages in random order and collect all links that ends with "tar.Z".

Page urls with at least one link will be stored in "data/valid_page_urls.xz".
Page urls with no archive links will be stored in "data/invalid_page_urls.xz".
Links will be stored in "data/archive_urls.xz".

It is possible to view these lists by using "less data/valid_page_urls.xz".

-----

Archive urls will be visited in random order.
Lzws in all tests will be used using all possible versions (with different compressor dictionary types).

First test: lzws and ncompress will try to decompress it.

Second test: lzws and ncompress will try to recompress archive in any possible combinations using default options:
1. compress -d < archive.tar.Z | lzws | lzws -d
2. compress -d < archive.tar.Z | lzws | compress -d
3. compress -d < archive.tar.Z | compress | compress -d
4. lzws -d < archive.tar.Z | lzws | lzws -d
5. lzws -d < archive.tar.Z | lzws | compress -d
6. lzws -d < archive.tar.Z | compress | compress -d

If there are 2 lzws versions (2 compressor dictionary types), so this list will have 12 commands.
This test won't take much time.

Third test: lzws will try to recompress archive using all possible combinations of options.
1. lzws -d < archive.tar.Z | lzws --max-code-bit-length=9 | lzws -d --max-code-bit-length=9
2. lzws -d < archive.tar.Z | lzws --max-code-bit-length=10 | lzws -d --max-code-bit-length=10
...

There are 64 possible option combinations for lzws.
If there are 2 lzws versions (2 compressor dictionary types), so this list will have 128 commands.
This test can take a long time.

All test are running in memory only.
Test are more CPU than I/O intensive.
It is safe to run tests on SSD.

Archive is invalid when both lzws and ncompress fails to decompress it.
Archive is valid when both lzws and ncompress provides same content for each test.
Archive is volatile when lzws and ncompress provides different content for any test.

-----

Invalid archives are stored in "data/invalid_archives.xz".
Valid archives are stored in "data/valid_archives.xz".
Volatile archives are stored in "data/volatile_archives.xz".

Format of list is "#{archive url} #{sha256sum of archive}".
Archives with same digest won't be tested again.
They will be just stored in related list.

You can count unique archives.
For example: 'xzcat data/valid_archives.xz | cut -d " " -f 2 | sort | uniq -c | sort'.

Volatile archives list is the main result of this test.
If volatile archives list are empty - lzws and ncompress are 100% compatible.
If volatile archives list are not empty - please view "less data/volatile_archives.xz" and check these archives.

How to use these scripts?

1. Install rvm
curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

2. Install modern version of ruby
rvm install ruby-2.6.2

3. Install required gems
cd scripts/tar-z-collector
bundle install

4. Start tor
Please use some convenient timeout like "SocksTimeout 20".
sudo rc-service tor start

5. Updated urls
./bin/update_urls.sh

6. Test archives
./bin/test_archives.sh

-----

You can run these script in infinite loop to collect and test more data.

./bin/loop_update_urls.sh
./bin/loop_update_urls_and_test_archives.sh

After about 1 week you will receive more than 6000 valid archives.

You updated something, how to re-test everything?
./bin/clear_archives.sh
./bin/test_archives.sh
